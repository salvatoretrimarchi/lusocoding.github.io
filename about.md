Hi, my name is Nuno Barreiro. I'm a programmer, consultant, blogger, technologist and enthusiast gamer. I've worked for many companies throughout the years which allowed me to gain a lot of experience in multiple business areas. I also like to write and to share my knowledge and experience and so I started this blog. Needless to say that all content and opinion in this site are my own.

If you want to follow my latest updates please subscribe to my blog's [RSS feed]({{ 'feed.xml' | relative_url }}), or you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username| cgi_escape | escape }}) or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username| cgi_escape | escape }}).
